# Documentation

I'm doing my best to add documentation. This library is a work in progress. I add documentation in small pieces, in the form of markdown files that use [the mdme project](https://github.com/susam/mdme) to convert it to html. This allows me to add and edit the documentation directly in the Github web interface without using Git at all. This is an experiment to see how low I can push the overhead of documenting my work while still providing acceptable documentation.
